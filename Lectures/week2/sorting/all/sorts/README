NOTE:

As provided, the programs in this directory sort integers. This is
because of the typedefs and #defines in Item.h. In order to sort other
types, you will need to create a new Item.h to replace the given one.
The file StrItem.h has been provided as an example.


INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Compile with make

2. Use the ./gen program to generate integers

3. Redirect output from the ./gen program to a sorting program

   For example:

       ./gen 10 R | ./selectionSort

4. Time the sorting program by adding "time" before the sorting program,
   and redirect the output to /dev/null

   For example:

       ./gen 10 R | time ./selectionSort > /dev/null
