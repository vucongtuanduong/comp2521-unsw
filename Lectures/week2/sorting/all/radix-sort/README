NOTE:

This directory contains a radix sort and a merge sort for comparison.


INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Compile with make

2. Use the ./gen program to generate data

3. Redirect output from the ./gen program to a sorting program

   For example:

       ./gen 10 | ./radixSort

4. Time the sorting program by adding "time" before the sorting program,
   and redirect the output to /dev/null

   For example:

       ./gen 10 | time ./radixSort > /dev/null
